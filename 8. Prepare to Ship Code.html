<h1>Step 8: Prepare to Ship Code</h1>

<p>
	If you don't care about ever publishing apps, consider yourself done; this is a bonus section to give a high-level overview of how publishing apps to Google Play works.  I'll refer to caveats in passing, but for now, I'll assume we're dealing with the simplest case: a free app in which it doesn't matter which countries can access it.
</p>

<p>
	First, you <i>must</i> test your app thoroughly on every kind of device you're targeting--tablets, phones with a range of screen sizes, etc.
</p>
<p>
	For your own sake, JavaDoc your code so you can more easily remember it's functionality later. Self-documenting code is very rare--especially 3 months after you've touched it.  Also, remove all log calls and remove <code>android:debuggable</code> as an attribute from the manifest.
</p>
<p>
	Next, compile a release version of your code and test it on at least one target device.  Go to the Gradle panel on the right side of the IDE, under All Tasks expand <code>BuildSystemExample</code>, expand <code>:app</code> and double-click on <code>assembleRelease</code>.

<p>
	This produces a signed APK (application package) ready for distribution.  A digital signature is generated by using a hash function along with a key that your computer generates.  The signature ensures that you have indeed published the app and that no one has tampered with it, thus preventing the spread of malware since anyone can verify that the signature is valid but only you can generate it for a given input file.  For details on how to run this APK on devices, see this <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-studio.html#buildRelease">link</a>.  By default, the APK is also run through ProGuard, a tool that compresses the APK and optimizes and obfuscates code so it's more difficult to reverse engineer and is more efficient.  ProGuard is only invoked in release mode so that it's easier to debug code in debug mode.

<h3>Publishing</h3>

<p>
	All details regarding publishing can be configured in the <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/">Google Play Developer Console</a>.  Google Play requires that you determine the app's maturity rating, the countries in which it should be distributed, its price (which can be varied by country), and with which devices and Android platform versions it is compatible.  If this is your first time publishing, you'll need to pay $25 to <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6112435?hl=en&ref_topic=3450769">set up</a> a Google Play Developer Account--both for apps that are free and for those that have a price.  You will receive money from the sales of apps by your <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3092739?hl=en&ref_topic=3452890">Google Wallet Merchant account</a>.  If you decide that the app will be free, you cannot change it to being priced later.  However, you can sell in-app products or subscriptions with Google Play's <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/in-app-billing/index.html">in-app billing service</a>.
</p>

<p>
	It's advisable that any remote servers on which your app interacts are scalable to be able to handle the load of a large user base if your app were to become popular.  The use of expandable, pay-for-what-you-use cloud services are ideal for uncertainty in popularity; <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> is one example of such a resource.  To test it, it may be good to consider beta testing; you can <a href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/developer-console.html#alpha-beta">manage</a> versions for testing and authorized testers from the Google Play Developer Console.  Finally, you ought to prepare promotional material--images, advertisements, and videos--to stir up hype for your app if that makes sense for the intent of the app.
</p>
<p>
	Once the app is on the app store, in order to keep a happy user base, you must maintain the app.  List known bugs for the sake of transparency on your app's store listing page, and then <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113476?hl=en">issue updates</a> to fix bugs and offer compatibility with new versions of Android.  As a final point of marketing, it's good to frequently check your ratings so you can be aware of trends in feedback from users.
