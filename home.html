This tutorial will also follow a Model-View-Controller model, which will assist with the material taught in the class itself. This tutorial will start from IDE installation and set up and cover everything up to testing and shipping out your code.</p>

<p> This tutorial employs dynamic code segments, which are blocks of code that can be expanded to include comments and explanations about what is being coded. There will be a picture of a triangle that serves as a drop down button for any piece of code that you see that is a dynamic code segment.<input type="button" class="dynamicTriangle"/>
