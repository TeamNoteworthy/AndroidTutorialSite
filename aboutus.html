<h1> About Us </h1>
<h3> Welcome! <h3>
<p> Welcome CS 2340 student! If you're reading this page, you are most likely taking CS 2340 with Professor Bob Waters during the semester the class is taught in Android rather than Java. The purpose of this tutorial is to serve as a tool for student who have a Java background to become proficient with Android development within the two hours it takes to finish this tutorial. This web Android tutorial was created by a Junior Design project team with the intent of assisting computer science students build a foundation in Android development.</p>

<h3> Purpose </h3>
<p> This web tutorial will lead the student through the creation of a Android notetaking application that utilizes activity-to-activity transitions, persistence in the form of a SQL Lite database, and manipulation of the Android layout and menu options for each activity necessary to create the application. The purpose of the web tutorial is to teach the majority of students about Android development, especially those students who have minimal to no Android development background. At this point, there is no free, up-to-date tutorial on the internet that students can follow to learn the basics of Android development. This tutorial will also follow a Model-View-Controller model, which will assist with the material taught in the class itself. This tutorial will start from IDE installation and set up and cover everything up to testing and shipping out your code. We hope you find the tutorial and the content covered beneficial! </p>

<h3> Dynamic Sections </h3> 
<p> This tutorial employs dynamic code segments, which are blocks of code that can be expanded to include comments and explanations about what is being coded. There will be a picture of a triangle that serves as a drop down button for any piece of code that you see that is a dynamic code segment. </p>
