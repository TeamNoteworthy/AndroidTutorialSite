<h1>Step 5: Persistence in Android</h1>
<p>
	The first question I assume you’re asking right now is: “What is persistence?” It’s pretty much what you think--we want the phone application to persist! Well what does persist even mean? It means that when you close the application, data and settings should be preserved somewhere so that the app picks up where you left off. An application for taking notes or adding notes about various things would be pretty pointless if you lost all of the notes after you closed the application!
</p>
<p>
	Before I talk about persistence in the context of this android application, I’d like to discuss persistence in applications in general because it’s important to understand how it works from a higher level before diving in to the application’s version. Persistence is a wide and varied subject, and there are many ways to implement it. The main idea behind persistence is that data is stored in a place outside the application, and the application must have some way of retrieving that information to display it to the user again. There are ways to implement persistence where the program literally saves its entire <b>state</b>, but for an Android application, this is both unnecessary and impractical. Fully saving a software state is a fairly complicated procedure, and usually requires some assistance from an operating system of some kind to be implemented. To be implemented quickly and/or efficiently, it requires special data structures and a lot more details I don’t want to get in to. Suffice to say it’s not really all that useful unless your application is a game, where the total state of the application could be important to the gameplay. Since our application is one for taking notes, the state of the notes is irrelevant, the information we need is the text contained within the note. The most common way to store information in an organized way is through the use of a <b>database</b>.
</p>
<h2>What is a database?</h2>
<p>
	Databases can be complicated tools, to be sure, but for this application, we’re using Android’s built-in SQLite functionality. SQLite is a variation of SQL that works on specially formatted text files stored locally on the user’s system of choice. Since SQLite stores the files in question on the local system, we can use it to store notes locally on the users’ machine to be “reloaded” when the application opens again. Before you can understand how this fully works, you need to understand what a database is, and how one typically works.
</p>
<p>
	In a database, data is structured in <b>tables</b>. Tables consist of columns that help define how the rows in the table should be structured. A good example is a table that looks like this:
</p>

<div style="margin:0 auto; padding: 0;">
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><b>EmployeeID</b></td>
			<td><b>First Name</b></td>
			<td><b>Last Name</b></td>
			<td><b>Department</b></td>
			<td><b>Gender</b></td>
			<td><b>Salary</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1092384</td>
			<td>John</td>
			<td>Smith</td>
			<td>Sales</td>
			<td>M</td>
			<td>$50,000</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1251290</td>
			<td>Susan</td>
			<td>Thomas</td>
			<td>Marketing</td>
			<td>F</td>
			<td>$50,000</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>

<p>
	This is a table called Employee Data, and it has six columns that define the information contained within. For this example, those column names are <b>EmployeeID, First Name, Last Name, Department, Gender,</b> and <b>Salary</b>. This means that every row in this table will have some data associated with some amount of each of these six different columns. Sometimes there might not be data in a spot in a row, this is allowed sometimes, and dealing with something like that is dependent on how you implement your database communication. The important reason why tables are formatted this way are because you can search the database based on information contained within the columns. This is great when you want to find specific information quickly. With databases, in order to retrieve information, you use queries which are basically like asking the database a question, similar to how you’d ask someone in real life. There is a standardized language for these questions, and it is called SQL which stands for Standard Query Language. SQL allows for asking questions such as “Which employees make more than $50,000 per year?” with just a little code.
</p>
<p>
	SQL has its uses, and SQLite is a way to use SQL to “query” specially formatted text files in an efficient manner that’s useful for smaller stores of data (like user-defined Notes). We don’t need the query functionality for this particular application, but we do need a way to keep the Note data organized into separate parts so that we can rebuild things like the title and Note body text separately. To begin, here’s what the structure of our table looks like:
</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<div style="margin:0 auto; padding: 0;">
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><b>_id</b></td>
			<td><b>title</b></td>
			<td><b>text</b></td>
			<td><b>date</b></td>
			<td><b>color</b></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>

<p>
	The _id field is sort of special thing for database rules. Basically the main thing you need to know as a programmer here is that databases need a way to differentiate each row, which means that there needs to be some way that each row is unique. Normally this could be done through the note title and body text, but what if the user wants to have several notes with the exact same content for some reason? Something like two notes called Grocery List, or some other simple example. This id field is handled by the database, we can tell it that it’s a special integer that the database just needs to increment every time it adds a row to the table. This guarantees “row-uniqueness” and allows as many duplicate rows for the last four columns as we desire.
</p>
<p>
	Giving each note a unique identifier also allows us to later update and change the data within a specific note. We will be using it for updates to notes and deletions, but that’s about it. This is still extremely important, so I don’t want to discount its usefulness.
</p>
<p>
	Now that we’ve given you a brief overview of what a database is and how it functions, it’s time to jump into the actual code that makes it do things for us!
</p>
<h2>The actual code</h2>
<p>
	So for Android specifically, we’re going to need two parts of code. One part is the “helper” part that serves to initialize the database table we want correctly, and then the other part is for actually changing data inside of that table. The very first part of code is rather short, and can be seen on the following page.
</p>
<p>
	You’ll notice that this class <b>extends</b> SQLiteOpenHelper. SQLiteOpenHelper is a class built in to Android whose main purpose is to help open SQLite tables correctly. That’s almost all this class does too, but I’ll go over everything anyway.
</p>
<p>
	The main first few lines are just defining some public constant variables that we can use throughout the application to reference the column names of the notes table correctly. They’re declared as final so that they don’t get changed during runtime because that would cause plenty of other problems. The database version variable is mainly something to keep Android happy, and we don’t make use of it in the application, but it’s pretty obvious to see what it does.
</p>
<p>
	The next part of this class is the substance of the entire operation at this point. It’s literally just a giant string that ends up being used as the SQL query to create the database properly. The string ends up looking something like:
</p>
<code>
CREATE TABLE notes (_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, title TEXT NOT NULL, text TEXT, date TEXT, color TEXT)
</code>
<p>
	This creates a table called “notes” that has five columns called _id, title, text, date, and color. The text that is in all capital letters after the column name tells the SQLite handlers of android what type of data goes in the “slots” so-to-speak.
</p>
<p>
	The NoteSQLiteHelper constructor just initializes the class with Android’s SQLiteOpenHelper class correctly, using the context of the app it came from, etc. etc. Again, mostly just details to keep Android happy. 
</p>
<p>
	The onCreate() function is called when the database needs to be created (more on this shortly), and the onUpgrade function can do many things, but we decided to use it primarily during testing to refresh the entire database of notes at once if necessary. On to the next parts of code!
</p>
<code>
TODO: Put SQLiteOpenHelper HERE
</code>
<p>
	The next code to look at is the whole point of the helper class, which is to actually go into the database and edit and change stuff as we please. The code for this entire process is below:
</p>
<code>
TODO: Put NoteSQLiteDBModel HERE
</code>
<p>
	Since we’ve decided to use the Model-View-Controller design paradigm for this project, this class is called the NoteSQLiteDBModel. It’s a “model” of the SQLite database that the rest of the application can use to display stuff to the user.
</p>
<p>
	The beginning of the class consists of some pretty standard variable definitions that are mostly self-explanatory based on their names. The allColums[] array might look scary, but it’s to help us out with SQL queries later since one of the arguments takes an array of the columns you want to query.
</p>
<p>
	The NoteListAdapter that you see here is the list adapter that’s actually displaying all the notes from earlier in the tutorial. The main reason this is here is because we need to call adapter.notifyDataSetChanged() periodically so that the main screen knows that the ArrayList containing the actual Note objects has changed, and so its screen should change too. So if the user decides to change the title or body text of a note or something, then obviously the user wants to see that change on the screen.
</p>
<p>
	So the first function that you can see here is called refreshNotes(). This function’s sole purpose is to refresh the notes ArrayList correctly so that the rest of the application gets an updated set of notes objects. A cursor object is basically what it sounds like. Whenever you query a database, it returns some number of rows for you to look at. A cursor is an object that “points” at one particular row (usually the first one to start with), and can therefore tell you the data inside any particular column of that row.
</p>
<p>
	Note: If the query() function looks scary with all those nulls, it’s really not that complicated. Here’s what the Android manual defines these various options as:
</p>
<code>
query(String table, String[] columns, String selection, String[] selectionArgs, String groupBy, String having, String orderBy, String limit)
</code>
<p>
	Most of those terms are SQL-related, and if you specifically need to know what they mean, you can read up on some SQL on your own. We don’t need any of them for this project since we just want to go ahead and pull everything from the database so we can show all the notes to the user.
</p>
<p>
	Since this function refreshed the notes ArrayList, we need to call the notifyDataSetChanged() from earlier so that the user’s screen updates properly.
</p>
<p>
	The restart DB function just calls the onUpgrade() function from the SQLiteOpenHelper class that we defined earlier. It’s basically a dummy function that drops and recreates the Notes table in case we need to entirely recreate the database.
</p>
<p>
	The cursorToNote() function is just a small helper function that uses the specific parts of a cursor’s syntax to properly populate a Note object that we can populate the notes ArrayList later.
</p>
<p>
	createNote() and saveNote() are very similar functions, but createNote() calls a database.insert() query, and saveNote() calls a database.update() query. The very first part of these functions uses what is called a ContentValue. In Android, there is a class that works behind the scenes called the ContentResolver. This ContentResolver knows what to do with certain types of data when it’s called in particular ways, so it makes our lives as programmers much easier. The best part about content values in Android is that we can just tell the database we want to insert them, and it’ll do all the work for us.
</p>
<p>
	A small note on updateNote(). For SQL, in order to update a specific note, you need some kind of identifier for it. This is done currently by the note’s _id field in the database. This is useful because it’s stored inside the Note object anyway, so we can tell the database to update a specific row where the _id field is equal to whatever note we’d like to update. This is how we update information instead of deleting the note, and recreating it every time. It mainly serves to save some computer workload, and it’s less wasteful.
</p>
<p>
	deleteNote() does the same thing that updateNote() does, except since it’s deleting a note, the only thing the SQLite database cares about is which specific note to delete. We can specify this by ID really easily, and the SQLite database will delete the entry from the database. When this entry is deleted, we have to recreate the notes ArrayList again, which is why refreshNotes() is called at the end of the function.
</p>
<h2>Finishing Thoughts</h2>
<p>
	That’s pretty much it as far as the Android Persistence goes! This part is very basic-looking, but it involves a deeper understanding of background information more than it requires actual coding prowess or understanding. The important thing to take away from this section from the tutorial is that when you implement a background database, keep the database access functions as simple as possible. Let the SQLite engine in Android do the work for you if you can because as it turns out, it’s pretty darn quick! On to the next part of the tutorial.
