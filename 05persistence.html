<h1>Step 5: Persistence in Android</h1>

<h4>Source Code for just this step: <button class="sourceCode"><a style='text-decoration:none' href="https://github.com/TeamNoteworthy/AndroidNoteApp/tree/05-Persistence/app/src/main/java/edu/gatech/androidnoteapp">Source Code</a></button></h4>

<p>
	The first question that you’re asking right now is: “What is persistence?” It’s pretty much what you think--the phone application should persist! Well what does persist even mean? It means that when you close the application, data and settings should be preserved somewhere so that the app picks up where you left off. An application for taking notes or adding notes about various things would be pretty pointless if you lost all of the notes after you closed the application!
</p>
<p>
	Before talking about persistence in the context of this android application, let's discuss persistence in applications in general because it’s important to understand how it works from a higher level before diving in to the application’s version. Persistence is a wide and varied subject, and there are many ways to implement it. The main idea behind persistence is that data is stored in a place outside the application, and the application must have some way of retrieving that information to display it to the user again. There are ways to implement persistence where the program literally saves its entire <b>state</b>, but for an Android application, this is both unnecessary and impractical. Fully saving a software state is a fairly complicated procedure, and usually requires some assistance from an operating system of some kind to be implemented. To be implemented quickly and efficiently, it requires special data structures and a lot more details that aren't necessary. Suffice to say it’s not really all that useful unless your application is a game, where the total state of the application could be important to the gameplay. Since our application is one for taking notes, the state of the notes is irrelevant, the information needed is the text contained within the note. The most common way to store information in an organized way is through the use of a <b>database</b>.
</p>
<h2>What is a database?</h2>
<p>
	Databases can be complicated tools, to be sure, but for this application, we're using Android’s built-in SQLite functionality. SQLite is a variation of SQL that works on specially formatted text files stored locally on the user’s system of choice. Since SQLite stores the files in question on the local system, the SQLite can use it to store notes locally on the users’ machine to be “reloaded” when the application opens again. Before you can understand how this fully works, you need to understand what a database is, and how one typically works.
</p>

<div>
<div class="dynamicSection">
<p>
	In a database, data is structured in <b>tables</b>. Tables consist of columns that help define how the rows in the table should be structured. A good example is a table that looks like this:
</p>

<div style="margin:0 auto; padding: 0;">
	<table style="border:1px solid #000;">
		<tr>
			<td><b>EmployeeID</b></td>
			<td><b>First Name</b></td>
			<td><b>Last Name</b></td>
			<td><b>Department</b></td>
			<td><b>Gender</b></td>
			<td><b>Salary</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1092384</td>
			<td>John</td>
			<td>Smith</td>
			<td>Sales</td>
			<td>M</td>
			<td>$50,000</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1251290</td>
			<td>Susan</td>
			<td>Thomas</td>
			<td>Marketing</td>
			<td>F</td>
			<td>$50,000</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>

<p>
	This is a table called Employee Data, and it has six columns that define the information contained within. For this example, those column names are <b>EmployeeID, First Name, Last Name, Department, Gender,</b> and <b>Salary</b>. This means that every row in this table will have some data associated with some amount of each of these six different columns. Sometimes there might not be data in a spot in a row, this is allowed sometimes, and dealing with something like that is dependent on how you implement your database communication. The important reason why tables are formatted this way are because you can search the database based on information contained within the columns. This is great when you want to find specific information quickly. With databases, in order to retrieve information, you use queries which basically ask the database a question, similar to how you’d ask someone in real life. There is a standardized language for these questions, and it is called SQL which stands for Standard Query Language. SQL allows for asking questions such as “Which employees make more than $50,000 per year?” with just a little code.
</p>
<p>
	SQL has its uses, and SQLite is a way to use SQL to “query” specially formatted text files in an efficient manner that’s useful for smaller stores of data (such as user-defined Notes). The query functionality is pretty simple for this particular application, but let's keep the Note data organized into separate parts so that it can rebuild things like the title and Note body text separately. To begin, here’s what the structure of our table looks like:
</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<div style="margin:0 auto; padding: 0;">
	<table style="border:1px solid #000;">
		<tr>
			<td><b>_id</b></td>
			<td><b>title</b></td>
			<td><b>text</b></td>
			<td><b>date</b></td>
			<td><b>color</b></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>

<p>
	The <code>_id</code> field is a special thing for database rules. Basically the main thing you need to know as a programmer here is that databases need a way to differentiate each row, which means that there needs to be some way that each row is unique. Normally this could be done through the note title and body text, but what if the user wants to have several notes with the exact same content for some reason? Something like two notes called Grocery List, or some other simple example. This id field is handled by the database, and it’s a special integer that the database just needs to increment every time it adds a row to the table. This guarantees “row-uniqueness” and allows as many duplicate rows for the last four columns as we desire.
</p>
<p>
	Giving each note a unique identifier also allows us to later update and change the data within a specific note. It will be used for updates to notes and deletions, but that’s about it. This is still extremely important, so we don’t want to discount its usefulness.
</p>
</div></div>
<p>
	Now that a brief overview of what a database is and how it functions has been discussed, it’s time to jump into the actual code that makes it do things for us!
</p>
<h2>The actual code</h2>
<p>
	So for Android specifically, there are two parts of code. One part is the “helper” part that serves to initialize the database table correctly, and then the other part is for actually changing data inside of that table. The very first part of code is rather short, and can be seen on the following page.
</p>
<p>
	You’ll notice that this class <b>extends</b> <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code>. <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code> is a class built in to Android whose main purpose is to help open SQLite tables correctly. That’s almost all this class does too.
</p>
<p>
	The main first few lines are just defining some public constant variables that can be used throughout the application to reference the column names of the notes table correctly. They’re declared as <code>final</code> so that they don’t get changed during runtime because that would cause plenty of other problems. The database version variable is mainly something to keep Android happy, and won't be used in this application, but it’s pretty obvious to see what it does.
</p>
<p>
	The next part of this class is the substance of the entire operation at this point. It’s literally just a giant string that ends up being used as the SQL query to create the database properly. The string ends up looking something like:
</p>
<code>
CREATE TABLE notes (_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, title TEXT NOT NULL, text TEXT, date TEXT, color TEXT)
</code>
<p>
	This creates a table called “notes” that has five columns called <code>_id</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>text</code>, <code>date</code>, and <code>color</code>. The text that is in all capital letters after the column name tells the SQLite handlers of android what type of data goes in the “slots” so-to-speak.
</p>
<p>
	The <code>NoteSQLiteHelper</code> constructor just initializes the class with Android’s <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code> class correctly, using the context of the app it came from, etc. etc. Again, mostly just details to keep Android happy. 
</p>
<p>
	The <code>onCreate()</code> function is called when the database needs to be created (more on this shortly), and the <code>onUpgrade()</code> function can do many things, but it is used during testing to refresh the entire database of notes at once if necessary. On to the next parts of code!

</code></pre>
</div></div>
<p>
	Since the Model-View-Controller design paradigm will be used for this project, this class is called the <code>NoteSQLiteDBModel</code>. It’s a “model” of the SQLite database that the rest of the application can use to display stuff to the user.
</p>
<p>
	The beginning of the class consists of some pretty standard variable definitions that are mostly self-explanatory based on their names. The allColums[] array might look scary, but it’s to help us out with SQL queries later since one of the arguments takes an array of the columns you want to query.
</p>
<p>
	The <code>NoteListAdapter</code> that you see here is the list adapter that’s actually displaying all the notes from earlier in the tutorial. The main reason this is here is to call <code>adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()</code> periodically so that the main screen knows that the <code>ArrayList</code> containing the actual <code>Note</code> objects has changed, and so its screen should change too. So if the user decides to change the title or body text of a note or something, then obviously the user wants to see that change on the screen.
</p>
<p>
	So the first function that you can see here is called <code>refreshNotes()</code>. This function’s sole purpose is to refresh the notes <code>ArrayList</code> correctly so that the rest of the application gets an updated set of notes objects. A cursor object is basically what it sounds like. Whenever you query a database, it returns some number of rows for you to look at. A cursor is an object that “points” at one particular row (usually the first one to start with), and can therefore tell you the data inside any particular column of that row.
</p>
<p>
	Note: If the <code>query()</code> function looks scary with all those nulls, it’s really not that complicated. Here’s what the Android manual defines these various options as:
</p>
<code>
query(String table, String[] columns, String selection, String[] selectionArgs, String groupBy, String having, String orderBy, String limit)
</code>
<p>
	Most of those terms are SQL-related, and if you specifically need to know what they mean, you can read up on some SQL on your own. None of these will be used since the application will pull everything from the database so all the notes can be shown to the user.
</p>
<p>
	Since this function refreshed the notes <code>ArrayList</code>, let's call the <code>notifyDataSetChanged()</code> from earlier so that the user’s screen updates properly.
</p>
<p>
	The restart DB function just calls the <code>onUpgrade()</code> function from the <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code> class that was defined earlier. It’s basically a dummy function that drops and recreates the <code>Notes</code> table in case it is necessary to entirely recreate the database.
</p>
<p>
	The <code>cursorToNote()</code> function is just a small helper function that uses the specific parts of a cursor’s syntax to properly populate a <code>Note</code> object so that it can populate the notes <code>ArrayList</code> later.
</p>
<p>
	<code>createNote()</code> and <code>saveNote()</code> are very similar functions, but <code>createNote()</code> calls a <code>database.insert()</code> query, and <code>saveNote()</code> calls a <code>database.update()</code> query. The very first part of these functions uses what is called a <code>ContentValue</code>. In Android, there is a class that works behind the scenes called the <code>ContentResolver</code>. This <code>ContentResolver</code> knows what to do with certain types of data when it’s called in particular ways, so it makes our lives as programmers much easier. The best part about content values in Android is that it can just tell the database to insert them, and it’ll do all the work by its own.
</p>
<p>
	A small note on <code>updateNote()</code>. For SQL, in order to update a specific note, you need some kind of identifier for it. This is done currently by the note’s <code>_id</code> field in the database. This is useful because it’s stored inside the <code>Note</code> object anyway, so the database can be told to update a specific row where the <code>_id</code> field is equal to whatever note we’d like to update. This is how we update information instead of deleting the note, and recreating it every time. It mainly serves to save some computer workload, and it’s less wasteful.
</p>
<p>
	<code>deleteNote()</code> does the same thing that <code>updateNote()</code> does, except since it’s deleting a note, the only thing the SQLite database cares about is which specific note to delete. Since this ID can be specified easily, and the SQLite database will delete the entry from the database. When this entry is deleted, we have to recreate the notes <code>ArrayList</code> again, which is why <code>refreshNotes()</code> is called at the end of the function.
</p>
<h2>Finishing Thoughts</h2>
<p>
	That’s pretty much it as far as the Android Persistence goes! This part is very basic-looking, but it involves a deeper understanding of background information more than it requires actual coding prowess or understanding. The important thing to take away from this section from the tutorial is that when you implement a background database, keep the database access functions as simple as possible. Let the SQLite engine in Android do the work for you if you can because as it turns out, it’s pretty darn quick! On to the next part of the tutorial.
